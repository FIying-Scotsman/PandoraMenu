# GTA V Pandora Menu (ENT Update 24)

### A GTA V PC Private menu based on the work of the ENT team, and ENT update 24. 

A previously updated ENT (Enhanced Native Trainer) fork which is now available just for code examples. 

I've since moved onto the official ENT repo, and with the help of other team members - release updates available here:

The updated ENT source is still private (due to it being a fork of a private repo - I can't change that easily) but interested parties can contact me directly for an invite.
